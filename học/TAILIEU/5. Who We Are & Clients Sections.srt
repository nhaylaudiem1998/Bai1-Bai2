1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,560
All right.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,420
So now we're going to start on the WHO WE ARE section so right underneath the what we do section.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:17,040
We're gonna put a comment and let's say section who we are and we're going to use a section tag with

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:25,710
an I.D. of who and you guys can see the the the pattern in how I do things so basically we have a header

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,040
at the top or head or NAV combination whatever and then everything under that is usually a section and

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,660
that's how I build pretty much all my web sites in you eyes.

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:45,570
So inside this section basically we're gonna have a flex box with two items which is gonna be one the

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,980
background image one is gonna be this side here.

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,660
And I want it to go all the way to the edge.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,770
So this goes all the way over this goes all the way over so we're not we're actually not going to use

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,280
a container in this section.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,640
So the section itself is gonna be the Flex box and then the two items let's do one we'll call it who

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,580
Dash I am G.

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,010
It's just going to be a background image.

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:19,810
So no no content inside the div and then let's call this one who dash text history of the image in the

16
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,690
way of the text and these are gonna be flexed flex items.

17
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:33,130
Now the WHO text we're going to also add a couple utility classes I want to add big dark tree stuff

18
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,910
to create and I'm going to do p. 2 I'm going to add some padding classes that have padding all the way

19
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:47,470
around that's why I don't have P Y P Y is for the up and down access P2 or P anything is going to be

20
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,240
padding all around as you can see that we have here.

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:02:01,680
So inside here it's put a H two and this H2 is gonna be an M heading so you can see that we we almost

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,560
create our own framework when we do this if you have any experience with bootstrap or any kind of each

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,360
team LCROSS framework you have built in classes that do certain things and that's pretty much what we're

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,300
doing is we're creating our own built in classes so that we can use them over and over instead of styling

25
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,200
you know the the WHO's section H to the what section H H2 and stuff like that we just have these base

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,430
utilities that we can use and I think that's the best way to do things.

27
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,550
So who is going to be inside the tech's primary

28
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,630
and if you don't know for instance bootstrap or front end framework like that then you'll see once you

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,440
start to learn bootstrap that a lot of these classes I actually take from from bootstrap like text primary

30
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:59,590
so let's do who and then outside of the span will do we are and then after the H two let's do a paragraph

31
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:07,600
and I think I did 30 here let's do Lorem 30 and then let's see underneath the paragraph we're gonna

32
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:17,670
have another h three or h three and we're gonna say our team and then a U L and I'm going to give this

33
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:26,520
you all a class of list because we need to style it it has some bottom borders take away the the bullet

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,900
points stuff like that.

35
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,820
So let's do an ally we have how many looks like what we have five here so times five and we'll just

36
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,970
put some names in here like Mark Smith will say that Mark is the CEO

37
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,580
and let's to Shannon Johnson the CFO

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,580
and see John Corbett I don't know where I get these names from a lead accountant

39
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,280
and let's see we have Janet Williams

40
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:29,540
investment manager and then finally we have Kara Jackson senior accountant and I tried to keep the names

41
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,600
you know with this this image right here actually I'm missing one I the six people here that that's

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
fine whatever you want to add another one you can.

43
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,170
All right.

44
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,860
So that's pretty much it for the section let's save it let's go back to ours and there we go so it looks

45
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,970
like crap obviously but we're gonna fix that.

46
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,820
So in our style CSX just gonna go ahead and make this a little smaller let's make sure that.

47
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,030
OK so that's still all right.

48
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,460
So let's go under the what section

49
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,630
it's good to keep your your CSX and your age team all commented out just just so you can see you know

50
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,060
what goes where I think it better organizes your your code.

51
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:27,900
So like I said Who itself the idea of who is going to be the Flex container so let's say I.D. who and

52
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:38,610
let's say we want to display flex flex and I want just equal sides.

53
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:47,930
So what I'm going to do is say any div that's inside the WHO div I'm going to say flex 1.

54
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,730
OK.

55
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,380
The divs are the Flex items right.

56
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,550
We have the section which is the Flex box or the Flex container.

57
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,990
And then each of these is the is the is the div or the item and I'm setting it to flex one.

58
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,740
So now it's just split half and half.

59
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,170
Now on this side I want the background image.

60
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,120
So let's do that.

61
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:19,520
Let's say the idea of who in the class of who dash image I'm going to set the background to a U.R.L.

62
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:27,970
and the image is gonna we want to go outside of CSX inside of image and we want the people dot J Peg

63
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,160
okay and we're going to add our no repeat.

64
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,330
We're going to center and cover

65
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,010
so now we have our image and then see

66
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
over here we shouldn't really have to do anything else we just make this a little bigger.

67
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,710
We shouldn't have to do anything except our utility classes because that'll cover the padding as well

68
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,940
as the background color.

69
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,690
So remember we have a big dark let's go up here where we have the beachy light.

70
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,580
I think we have a big light.

71
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,260
Oh we didn't even add that huh.

72
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,430
No we didn't.

73
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,780
All right.

74
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,550
So let's put that under the text here.

75
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:27,480
Let's say BFG light which has a background of light gray and color 3 3 3 and then let's also

76
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,380
copy this down and this is gonna be beachy dark

77
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,210
and then beachy dark.

78
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,320
We're just going to kind of reverse this.

79
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:50,260
So we're going to do 3 3 3 and then for the color let's switch we'll do white for the color colors and

80
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,670
save.

81
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:59,830
So now this has the light gray this as the dark we need to add some padding here or not add the padding

82
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,160
but add the class of I think we use P to you know use P too.

83
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,030
So let's go right under where we did all these paintings

84
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,730
copy it and I'll do just

85
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,880
do we do a dash.

86
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:29,350
Yeah P dash 2 so we have one two and three and I'm going to use the same amounts.

87
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,510
So one point five two and three except we want it to be on all sides.

88
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,850
We just want to get rid of the zero because um we just have this one value which will be for all sides

89
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,230
so let's save that.

90
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,770
And now check it out.

91
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,890
We have our padding.

92
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,600
We have our background color.

93
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,910
Well we didn't do is the list.

94
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:55,200
Now the list is I'm going to make this a utility because we might want to use this less styling somewhere

95
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:03,900
else so I don't want to I don't want to you know keep it inside the The Who div or the WHO I.D..

96
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,410
So the list I'm going to put under the button here

97
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:20,440
and let's first of all give it some margin on the top and bottom will do zero point five rim zero.

98
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,740
OK so now it's at least you have some space there.

99
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,990
And then I'm gonna take away the bullet points so list style none.

100
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,710
And for the list items

101
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,080
I'm going to add some padding to the top and bottom zero point five Ram.

102
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,290
And then let's add a border bottom and let's do four for four.

103
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,970
Let's two dotted has a style and one pixel and save.

104
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,990
OK.

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,990
So it's pretty good.

106
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,780
All right cool.

107
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,780
So let's see.

108
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,530
I think the clients section is easy enough for us to go ahead and do in this video.

109
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:25,110
So underneath who we are let's put section clients and we'll do a section with an idea of clients and

110
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,070
I want to add a class of p y one so padding.

111
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:38,550
It'll be one point five ram on the top and bottom and then we want a container because we want or we

112
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,810
want to move everything to the metal and we want an h to.

113
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm going to give this a class of M heading as well as text center and we're gonna say our clients but

114
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,330
the word our will be green.

115
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:01,240
So we want to do a span here of text primary we'll say our.

116
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,600
And then outside of the span we'll say clients.

117
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:14,530
Now we're going to use flex again here to align the images so we're going to do a class of items or

118
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,590
let's see.

119
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,550
Let's do um

120
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,380
you know what.

121
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,020
I think you if we look in our style CSX I mean just.

122
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,330
OK.

123
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,690
So we did target what items.

124
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:39,030
So it's we can use the class items here as well and inside items we're just going to have basically

125
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,510
a div with the image K so the div is going to be the actual flex item.

126
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,300
And then each div will have an image.

127
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:56,280
And this is gonna be dot slash since we're in the index each time l We want to be in the same folder

128
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,710
and then we want to go into the image folder and then we want to go into logos and I'm gonna do logo

129
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:08,130
one PMG and we make this a little bigger and then for the all.

130
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm just going to say also a client.

131
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:11,790
OK.

132
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:18,700
Obviously we don't put anything in here it's just the image but let's copy this down five times and

133
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,380
then we're just going to change the image.

134
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,410
Those will be local five four three and two.

135
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:34,220
And I'm also just going to add a P1 class here or p y one to add some padding here.

136
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,560
All right.

137
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,340
So let's save that and take a look.

138
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,710
OK.

139
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,480
So obviously it's just going to show it's just each image on a separate line because they're they're

140
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,660
in a div so divs are block level and we haven't we haven't made this a flex box yet.

141
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,180
So we want to do that so that we can align them.

142
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:05,170
So all right here let's say clients and let's take the client's I.D. and the items class and let's display

143
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,690
that as flex.

144
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,400
Once I do that you'll see that it's going to align them this way.

145
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,140
Now the images are way too big.

146
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,030
They're going off the screen here.

147
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:22,840
So I'm going to target clients items and then the images themselves.

148
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,450
And for one I'm going to display a block.

149
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,230
OK I want to be able to add a width to them.

150
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:35,770
I'm gonna say margin auto so that they're right in the center and then I'm going to set the width of

151
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,090
the image to 60 percent of its container and we'll save that.

152
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,920
And there we go.

153
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,220
OK.

154
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,980
So that's that's it for the client section.

155
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,610
So in the next video we're going to start to work on the contact and in the contact we have a little

156
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:58,600
form here we also have a map case or where we're gonna have to do to implement a map is get an API key

157
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,620
from Google Maps so you will have to log into your Google account and we're gonna use the console to

158
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,180
generate an API key.

159
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,310
OK.

160
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,470
And if and if you don't know what that is.

161
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,280
You know I've never heard of an API key.

162
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,190
Don't worry about it.

163
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,590
We're going to go step by step and we're gonna go through it.

164
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:16,990
All right.

165
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,310
So I'll see you in the next video.
