1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,110
All right guys next we're going to work on the showcase area.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,270
Now we have our nav bar up here.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,210
So right under the NAV it's got a comment.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:17,130
And let's just say header showcase really use the HMO five semantic header tag and it's actually given

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,950
an idea of showcase.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,030
We don't want to do that.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,610
This doesn't make any sense does it.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,110
I.D. equals showcase.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,480
OK.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,890
So in here we're gonna have a class of showcase dash content.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,820
I want to wrap all the content in that div because this is actually going to be a flex container even

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,520
though the elements are gonna be in a column going vertical we still we're still gonna use flex here

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,820
and then we're gonna put an H one and I want this H1 to be extra large so I'm actually going to have

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,120
a utility class called l dash heading and you're gonna see a lot of similarities through our projects

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,690
just different.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,810
Just the neat the ways that I name utility classes and so on and I mean you might come up with different

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:11,250
things but I think everyone has you know their their core class names just the way that they do things

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,130
everyone's different and I'm kind of showing you mine and you can adapt it or you can use your own it's

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,290
you know whatever you whatever you feel comfortable with.

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:29,670
So we're gonna say the sky is the limit and underneath the h 1 let's put a paragraph from when you use

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:39,150
the class of lead and we're gonna say Lorem 15 who put 15 words in here and under the paragraph we're

22
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,400
going to have an A tag with the class of B.T. and so we can style it.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,500
And it's going to go to idea of what and we're just going to say read more.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,090
OK so we'll just click it and I'll take it.

25
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,880
Take them to the what we do section.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,390
So let's save this.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,890
And this looks like this for now.

28
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:10,580
So let's head over to our style sheet and let's see let's add comment we'll see a showcase case source.

29
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,900
And we're gonna style the showcase area.

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,440
Let's start off with the showcase idea itself.

31
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,780
So for that we're gonna add a background.

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,600
This is where we want to add the background image.

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,330
So let's do let's do a color of three three three and then we'll do the U.R.L. will do the image over

34
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,670
it which is going to be we want to go dot dot slash because right now we're in the CSX folder we need

35
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,440
to navigate out of it and then into the image folder and then we want showcase dot j peg.

36
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,120
Okay.

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:53,500
And then after that I'm probably gonna have to make this a little bigger after that.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,880
Let's do a no repeat.

39
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:05,810
And we also want to do center center and we want it to cover the entire area.

40
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,100
Now we've we've gone over this before when we looked at VH units.

41
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,740
It's only going to cover the content.

42
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,480
OK so as far as the content reaches which is to this link it's going to cover that but we wanted to

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:29,770
cover the whole viewport as far as the height goes so let's say we want the height to be 100 VH and

44
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,510
save.

45
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,710
And now it's going to cover the whole viewport.

46
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,240
Now it is going to go a little lower because we have the the menu above it.

47
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:43,060
So it's basically going to add that spacing there which I don't see a problem you could add a negative

48
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,240
margin if you wanted to kind of pull it up a little bit and kind replace the the menu here but I'm not

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,470
going to do that I think that this is fine.

50
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,210
And then let's make the color of everything white and that's inside the showcase all right.

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,400
So now we'll do the showcase content.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:09,120
I'm just gonna make this a little smaller again so make sure this isn't what's size.

53
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,620
Let's say that should be fine.

54
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,140
Well we'll make this a little smaller

55
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:15,810
All right.

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:26,660
So let's do the showcase content so we have the I.D. showcase and then we have the class showcase content.

57
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,380
So like I said we're going to display flex.

58
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,800
Now as soon as I save that the default is to do a flex row which is horizontal.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,620
Now we don't want that we want a column.

60
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,410
So we're going to add in flex direction column as soon as I do that.

61
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,850
It'll go back to being vertical.

62
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,160
Now we want to align the items center both vertical and horizontal.

63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,150
So we want it centered this way and this way.

64
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,330
So we're going to use both justified content text a line and a line items.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,590
OK.

66
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,770
So let's first to the text.

67
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:17,450
So text align center OK and then we're also going to do a line dash actually to justify first or justify

68
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,510
content center.

69
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:32,660
Now if I do a line dash items center and save notice that it didn't it didn't center it vertically.

70
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,610
The reason for that is there's no height on the Flex container the showcase content.

71
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,360
There is a height on the Showcase which is 100 viewport heights but not on the actual flex container.

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,910
So we do have to add a height here.

73
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,730
And for the height I'm going to say I want it to be 100 percent of its container.

74
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,900
So 100 percent of the showcase which is 100 viewport heights once I save that then it will go to the

75
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,170
middle or to the center.

76
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:06,390
And let's see I'm also going to add some padding here.

77
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:14,920
Let's do padding zero and then let's do two ram on the left and right and save that.

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,130
So that will that should bring in away from the sides a little bit.

79
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:31,110
Now for the overlay we're going to basically we're going to position this absolute so that we can cover

80
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,410
the entire thing the entire showcase content.

81
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:46,770
So let's put out a comment here and say overlay and let's to position absolutes and let's say we want

82
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,130
the high already did 100 percent height.

83
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,150
Let's set.

84
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:00,030
Basically we wanted to start and see let's do top.

85
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:07,040
Now if I do top zero this is the thing since it's absolute top zero is going to start at the very top

86
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,340
meaning above the the the nav bar.

87
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,470
So let me just show you the top bottom.

88
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:28,090
Let's just do top left zero and let's add a background dash color and we can use our G.B. a.

89
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,990
So this is red green blue Alpha.

90
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:37,470
Basically we can do our G.B. so the red green blue values and then Alpha is actually the transparency.

91
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,870
OK.

92
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:46,820
So I want it to be black with a transparency which goes between 0 1 1 0 0 0 point 1 zero point two all

93
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,530
the way up to 1 which is no transparency at all so black would be all zeros red green blue and then

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,180
the opacity or the the alpha transparency whatever you want to call it.

95
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,850
If we said 1 and we save it's just going to there's there's no transparency at all if I do zero point

96
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,490
nine there'll be a little bit transparent as you can see I want zero point four I think that's a good

97
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,900
value.

98
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,970
And now notice that there's it's darker over the image but the text isn't OK.

99
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:25,710
So we if we just set no positive value on the showcase content the text would also have that opacity

100
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,870
and we don't want that we'd only want the background to have it.

101
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,150
Now as you can see there's some there's some area here that's not covered and that's because of the

102
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,990
nav bar the way that we did this to incorporate the sticky menu.

103
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,370
We have to kind of add a couple that are really hacks but just extra things that we have to do.

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,070
So instead of doing top zero I'm going to say top sixty five pixels because that's the the exact number

105
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,890
of pixels of the menu.

106
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,340
So let's save that.

107
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,110
And now you can see that.

108
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,580
It goes all the way.

109
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,460
Actually I think I did a little too much.

110
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,370
Let's do 60 CEO Seo we have this little spacing up here.

111
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,730
Sixty three gnome 60 and yet so that should be good.

112
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,850
Now we have the overlay once we have our responsive our mobile dot CSF CSX we'll have to tweak it a

113
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:24,420
little bit in the media query because the manual will reach down further because remember that the links

114
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,670
get put under the logo and if you don't want to have the overlay that's fine if you don't want to deal

115
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,200
with the extra properties and hassle you have to.

116
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,600
But I think it makes the text a little more readable.

117
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,740
So next thing I want to do is is this content here which we have a bunch utility classes.

118
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:53,310
The heading has a class of L dash headings so let's go up to our utilities are and let's add L or class

119
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,080
of L heading.

120
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,530
Let's see the font size for the al heading is going to be for RAM

121
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,710
for RAM.

122
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,640
Save that.

123
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,840
That gets much bigger.

124
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:25,490
Let's also let's do a margin bottom and for the margin bottom let's do zero point seventy five Ram.

125
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,460
And then I also want a line height of one point one.

126
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,780
So save that.

127
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,630
And if something I do if it doesn't look right to you.

128
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,180
Like if you want less margin or more margin or padding or something feel free to ta ta to mess with

129
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,980
it.

130
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,810
And then this paragraph has a class of lead.

131
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:53,800
So let's add our class of lead here they're going to set the font size number one room is 16 pixels

132
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm going to do one point three ram make it a little bigger and then let's add some margin bottom let's

133
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,900
two to room margin bottom.

134
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:04,780
Okay.

135
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:14,980
And then this has a class of B T N so it's do B T N and I wanted to display as an inline block

136
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,140
and I want to add some actually to the color.

137
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:30,580
So the color is gonna be white and then the background is gonna be that green color which is hexadecimal

138
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:37,760
and it's gonna be 9 three C B five two.

139
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,340
OK so save that.

140
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,150
We also want some padding for the padding I'm going to do zero point five Ram.

141
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:53,100
Top and bottom and two Ram left and right and let's do.

142
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,890
Let's see.

143
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,730
Let's do a border.

144
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,690
None.

145
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:02,540
Because if we happen to add this class to an actual button that's not a link.

146
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:11,180
Those have borders but we want to remove them but we do want rounded corners so let's do border radius

147
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,180
five pixels.

148
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,920
There we go.

149
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,440
Now I do want to have a hover state so that it changes a little bit on hover.

150
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:33,510
So let's go over it under it and let's say Beatty and hover and let's set the background to.

151
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,500
Now the background.

152
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,200
It's just gonna be a bit lighter than that green.

153
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:45,640
I think it's lighter it might be darker but it's seven A B four three six.

154
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,310
And that's all we want is to change the background.

155
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,620
Yeah.

156
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,640
So if I hover over it it gets a little darker.

157
00:12:51,740 --> 00:13:02,420
Now we're also going to add a Beatty and Beatty and dark class and give that a background of dark gray

158
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,820
and a color of white.

159
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,400
In case you want to use that class later.

160
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,230
So I think that that's it for the showcase area.

161
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:20,570
Actually one more thing I wanted to add on that I forgot was a line height for the body.

162
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,780
So I'm going to do line height one point four.

163
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,710
All right.

164
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,600
That all just you know I think it looks cleaner because it separates the lines a little bit but in the

165
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,440
next video we're going to start on the boxes.

166
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,630
OK.

167
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,910
So we're gonna use flex for that as well and we may move on to the next section we'll see how much time

168
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,570
we have.

169
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:38,800
All right.

170
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,000
So I'll see you in the next video.
