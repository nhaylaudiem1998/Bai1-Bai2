1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,080
All right so in the last video we did the header or the showcase area.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,550
So now we're going to move on to the.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,170
What we do section so we're gonna go in the H2 all file directly under the header.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,740
Let's put a comment here or we'll just say section and let's say what we do and we're gonna use in a

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,260
show five section tag and we're gonna give this an idea of what.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,520
Now if we look at the final version here we go down to the what we do you can see that there's it's

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,610
a light gray background also there's some padding on the top and bottom.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:42,930
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna add a class here of BMG dash light and then I'm gonna do a class

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,040
of P Y dash one K so remember I think we did this in the hotel website where we had the padding classes

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,580
so Pete the Y is the y axis.

11
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:00,330
Basically we want padding on top and bottom and we'll have p y one two and three and b g lt will be

12
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,360
the the light gray background.

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,000
OK.

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:09,840
Now we want to also have a container in here because we want the content to stay in the middle we don't

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,940
want it to go all the way over and then we're going to have an H to K and this H two is going to have

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,720
a class and I don't want it to be as large as the showcase heading which has a class of L headings so

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:33,750
let's do a m heading for medium so medium heading and then we're gonna have the text primary around

18
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,000
the word What.

19
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:42,910
K so we're gonna put a span in here with the class of text primary and we're going to say what.

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,160
And then after the span put a space and say we do OK.

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,960
And then under the H two is where we're going to put our boxes and we're going to just give this a class

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,710
of items which is gonna be our Flex container and then inside our Flex container we're gonna have these

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,850
three items as flex items so let's just give them a class of item.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,660
So we'll do item times three.

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,940
So we have three items and each one is gonna have an icon.

26
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,720
So it's two I class of font.

27
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,300
Awesome.

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:27,870
Also a class of F A Dash university is gonna be this first one here and I want to make it a little bigger

29
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:39,070
so let's do f a two X that'll increase it increase the size and then I also want a div with the h three.

30
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,530
This one will say investment banking

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,930
and then under that let's do a paragraph with law we'll do Lord 10.

32
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,520
OK.

33
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,230
And then I'm just going to copy the I.

34
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:03,390
The icon and the div and we want to do the same thing in both of these items except we want to change

35
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,820
of course the icon we don't want all the same icons this one is gonna be F.A. book dash reader and then

36
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:22,200
this last one is going to be FAA dash pencil dash opt in and let's just change the title so this next

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:34,300
one let's do portfolio management and then tax and custodial.

38
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,660
Okay now we'll save that.

39
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,620
Let's take a look at ours.

40
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,890
So it's going to look like this without any styling.

41
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:51,660
So now let's hop over to style CSX and we don't have the container yet so maybe we should do that first.

42
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,020
So let's see it's basically utility class.

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,830
So we'll go right here we'll say container and remember containers that we want to restrict it to a

44
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,180
certain width.

45
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:11,640
We want to give it a max width which I'm going to do eleven hundred pixels and then let's do margin

46
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,500
auto to make sure that it aligns in the middle.

47
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,340
And then just a little padding.

48
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,440
So I'll do zero top and bottom to ram left and right and let's do overflow hidden.

49
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,180
OK.

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,670
So save that and you can see we have some padding here and this is going to stay in the middle no matter

51
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:41,580
what another class we added was the M heading class actually know what I think I wanted to yeah I will

52
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,910
also want the the headings centred.

53
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:53,460
So in addition to m heading let's also add a class of text center and we'll go to our style sheet and

54
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:00,510
let's put text center and I just want that to align the text to the center.

55
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,350
So that takes in text align center.

56
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,690
OK so now that's moved to the center let's do the M heading.

57
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:20,540
So we should put that right under the L heading I'm just going to copy this and font size for the M

58
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:29,750
heading s change that is gonna be to REM and the margin bottom will leave that line height I guess we

59
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,410
are we can leave that as well.

60
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,370
So we'll save that.

61
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:35,960
Good.

62
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,080
So it's a little bigger.

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,670
Now we also added that p y one because we need to have some padding here and at the bottom so we might

64
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:49,490
as will add our padding classes now so I'll go to the bottom of the utility classes actually let's go

65
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,510
right above the button.

66
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,890
It doesn't really matter where you put this stuff but let's do P Y.

67
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:02,290
Class P Y 1 so padding C padding.

68
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,140
I'm going to do one point five Ram.

69
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,600
Top and bottom.

70
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:08,980
All right.

71
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:15,440
And actually know what I'll do is since we only have one property here Let's shorten this up a little

72
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:25,610
bit and then we'll copy this down and let's do two and three case we need to add more padding so to

73
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,660
Let's do two RAM and then three we'll do three ram.

74
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,740
So if we save that now you can see that we have some padding right here and if you want to make it bigger

75
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,870
you could give it p y two if you want.

76
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,170
OK.

77
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:48,710
So I think that's good for the utility classes now let's work on the Flex items here and we're also

78
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,320
gonna be styling the icon as well.

79
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,250
But let's take the items so I'm going to go down below the showcase and let's just say

80
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,570
section what we do.

81
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,210
OK.

82
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:15,160
So we have a class of items that wrap around all three and we want to display as a flex box.

83
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:25,320
So once we save that it's going to align them in let's take a guy who just make this smaller so we can

84
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,940
see both.

85
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,230
Let's take each item.

86
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,150
See what I want to do here.

87
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:45,080
Yeah let's take each item in center center all the content so we'll say dot item and let's out of flex

88
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:54,190
one and let's do text align center and save.

89
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,110
Case looks pretty good.

90
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:05,210
Let's also add padding to the item actually no one's going to do is add padding to the items itself

91
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:16,390
so we'll do one room here and then let's also do padding on each item one room and save.

92
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,440
So that kind of spreads it spreads stuff out a little bit.

93
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,900
Now let's see for the icon here.

94
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,480
I wanted to have that green circle around it.

95
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,560
So let's let's target that.

96
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,660
We'll go ahead and do.

97
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,650
Actually no.

98
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,790
Let's let's put the idea of what here.

99
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,290
So what.

100
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,620
And then items and then item we're just better targeting it.

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,220
And then here I'm going to say what items item.

102
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,410
And then we want to target the icon.

103
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,520
And we're gonna have a background of our grass green color which is going to be hexadecimal 9 3 C B

104
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:08,130
5 2 gives it that green and then to make it basically a circle.

105
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,720
Because if I save that it's going to hate how it just goes back up.

106
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,410
But unfortunately we just have to keep scrolling back down.

107
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,190
But you can see we have the green background.

108
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,190
So let's add some padding.

109
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:29,900
So we'll do one round of padding and to make it circle we want to do a border radius of 50 percent.

110
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,330
OK that'll give it that circle.

111
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,260
So if I saved that then we go.

112
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,330
We just want to add a little margin to the bottom to push the heading down.

113
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,100
So we'll say margin bottom one room.

114
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,900
Here we go.

115
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,670
Now as this gets bigger the reason I'm using.

116
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,050
No we have the widescreen CSX.

117
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,130
Well that's not right.

118
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,030
Okay so something.

119
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,000
What did what did we miss here.

120
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,560
So let's actually go back to the section content because that's where this overlay is.

121
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,160
And I think it's because we have it.

122
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,980
We have position absolute we have top comes down 60 left 0.

123
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:19,530
We should also add right zero because this is positioned absolute so we'll do right zero and bottom

124
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,670
zero.

125
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,040
So we wanted to start right on the edge.

126
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,200
I'll save that.

127
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,350
And now it brings it back to the edge.

128
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:36,360
So no matter how big or small this is you can see the overlay still covers it and it should still still

129
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,830
reach the bottom no matter what.

130
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:38,640
All right.

131
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,660
So sorry about that.

132
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,290
That little mistake there guys.

133
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:50,370
But anyways yeah when we have a wide screen I actually want the icons to go on the side here but I'm

134
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,740
not going to get into that until we get into the responsiveness we add that we actually start adding

135
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,100
styles to the mobile and the widescreen dot see ISIS file.

136
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,530
So I think that we're good for now and the next section or in the next video where either we're going

137
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:11,490
to start to work on the WHO WE ARE section which if we look at this it's just basically going to be

138
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,760
an image over here and then some text over here with a list or style it a little bit maybe we can get

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,610
the clients in in the next video as well.

140
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:20,840
All right.

141
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,600
So I'll see you then.
