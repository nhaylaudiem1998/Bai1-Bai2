1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,110
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,920
Now we're gonna start to work on the basically smartphone version of the of the website.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,630
So let's start off with the nav bar because that doesn't look too good.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,040
So in our mobile dot CSX I'm going to add a media query so this is for smart phones.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:28,980
So let's say at media and we'll say max width of 500 pixels

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,290
and let's see.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,870
So we're gonna target the nav bar first right.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:44,220
So it has an idea of nav bar and I'm going to change I'm going to actually keep the Flex but I'm going

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,120
to change the direction because we have it as a row which is horizontal.

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,470
Let's change it to column once I save that.

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,540
Now you can see that it's going this way instead of horizontal.

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,260
And I'm also going to add the A line dash items to the center and save.

13
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,490
And it already starts to look pretty good.

14
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,050
Now the logo I'm going to add some margin bottom I'm also going to make sure I text align it to the

15
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,500
center.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:25,080
So let's say nav bar let's target the logo and let's do margin bottom and we're gonna do zero point

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:37,490
five REM and let's do text align center and save that did that push it down.

18
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,070
Yeah I did.

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,570
Right.

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:42,990
Let's.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,240
Let's move it a little more so we'll do 7 5.

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,060
Actually it doesn't seem to be moving does it.

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,970
Logo

24
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,090
display none.

25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,790
So we are targeting it.

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,180
OK.

27
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,740
So I guess we'll just move it down a little more.

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,180
Let's do one run OK

29
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,500
so let's see for the well

30
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,400
padding actually the Well I think is let's say we had some padding to it.

31
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,820
So I would now bar.

32
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,690
Well

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,440
padding.

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,880
Zero point five Ram.

35
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,080
Oh that's why I had it.

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,730
Because of that padding so let's change this back to zero point five.

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,120
Here we go.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,580
OK.

39
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,300
Next thing

40
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,300
if we go down here notice that we now have this space.

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:08,010
That's because the nav bar the height has now grown in what we had before in our style sheet.

42
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,140
If we look at the showcase let's go up to showcase content.

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,540
We had top sixty five because that that basically made up for the now bar.

44
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,570
But now the now bar is bigger.

45
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:37,650
So let's do we're gonna go and say showcase content that's prefixes with I.D. showcase

46
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:46,130
and instead of sixty five let's say top 110 10 pixels and save.

47
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,600
And now if we go down you can see that there is no more space here.

48
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,870
So that covers it.

49
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,820
And if we make this bigger into the regular size it's fine.

50
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:03,640
So as soon as we hit 500 pixels it goes into this this menu here.

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,010
All right.

52
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,090
So let's see what else what else we have to do here.

53
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,610
So that looks good.

54
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,060
And we'll tell we'll test the devices after this here this this who area.

55
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:25,280
I want to get rid of the image and actually we're going to remove the Flex from the WHO I.D. because

56
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,620
right now this is a flex box and these two are flex items since we're are removing the this image here.

57
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,600
There's no need for flex.

58
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:45,230
So let's say who and we'll say display block and if I save that the image is going to go away because

59
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,950
now since the image is in part of a flex box it would need a height to display.

60
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,700
But I don't even want to display it at all so I'm just going to say who.

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,230
And then we're going to take the class of who Dash I am G which the image is wrapped in and we're simply

62
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,930
going to say display none OK so we'll save that.

63
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,440
All right so looks pretty good.

64
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,700
Next thing is the clients.

65
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,030
So I mean we could leave it like this but the images are really small.

66
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:28,540
So what I'd like to do is first of all increase the with so many say clients dot items and grab the

67
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,880
images themselves.

68
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,500
And we have 60 percent by default in style CSF.

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
Let's change it to 80 and save it.

70
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,800
But I want to remove the last one.

71
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:50,280
So what we can do is say client's items and grab the div but we want the last child we're going to use

72
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:57,560
the pseudo selector last child and say display display none.

73
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,650
So if you watch the last logo when I save this it goes away and I think that looks a little better.

74
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,320
They're bigger and there's less of them and we didn't even have to mess with the markup to get rid of

75
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,400
the logo.

76
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,460
Let's see now the contact.

77
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,680
We also want to remove the flax because we want these to stack.

78
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,170
We don't want them to align.

79
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,920
So let's say contact

80
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,100
and actually know we could try.

81
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:36,440
I did when I initially did this I did display block but let's try flex direction and let's do column

82
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,050
instead and see what that looks like.

83
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,210
OK.

84
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,610
Now the reason we can't see the map anymore is because since it's no longer basically attached to the

85
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,060
form horizontally we need to add a height.

86
00:06:50,060 --> 00:07:00,150
So let's say contact map excuse me and let's say height 200 pixels and save.

87
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,600
Now if we go down we can see the map and I also want to just have a little boy like a black border right

88
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,310
here.

89
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:13,970
So on the map let's say border top and you can see you can style it however you want on different screens.

90
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,910
I'm gonna do four pixels solid and three three three save.

91
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,620
And now we have square is it pixels light.

92
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,990
P.S. And now we have this border right here which is pretty cool so let's you know.

93
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,990
So once we hit 500 it turns into that

94
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,400
all right good.

95
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,630
Let's see

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,960
now the showcase content looks good in a browser but let's actually do the real test and look at it

97
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,540
on the device.

98
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,100
So we're going to open up our chrome tools and check out the device.

99
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,980
OK so this is an iPhone X and I think that looks pretty good.

100
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,280
Yeah.

101
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:13,880
Everything seems cool so let's check the iPhone 6 7 8 plus.

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,710
Good try.

103
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,400
Six seven eight.

104
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,880
Good

105
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,100
and see.

106
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:35,560
Galaxy Well we could we could move the showcase content up a little bit yeah.

107
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,480
Why don't we do that.

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,290
So let's see do we have a showcase content here.

109
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:40,950
No.

110
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,490
Yeah right here.

111
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,480
So showcase content.

112
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,350
We did top one hundred ten pixels.

113
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,650
Let's do a margin dash top.

114
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,730
But let's do a negative value in this.

115
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,770
What this will do is it will suck the content up.

116
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:07,980
So notice that right now on the galaxy the read more is kind of it's not in the in the you know the

117
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,570
viewport when you first enter.

118
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,780
I mean you can simply scroll down and it's fine.

119
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,610
But I'd like to just move this up a little bit.

120
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,780
So I'm going to do.

121
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,790
Negative.

122
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,880
It's too negative to REM and save.

123
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,490
And now this is actually in the you know above the fold is what they say.

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,210
And then even if we go on like an iPhone X it's still fine it's just up a little more that looks good.

125
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,580
And let's try the iPhone 5.

126
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,210
OK.

127
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:45,280
So if we wanted to look good on the iPhone 5 which has a very short height what we could do is lessen

128
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,320
the font size of the L heading.

129
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,210
But I'm only going to you know what.

130
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:57,890
I'm only going to do that if the height is five 68 or less.

131
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,360
Right.

132
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,240
Because this is a height of five sixty eight.

133
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,890
The iPhone 5 the six is six sixty seven.

134
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,090
Everything else is larger than that.

135
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:18,200
So what I'll do is I'll put an extra media query down here and I'm going to say Max height of five 68

136
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,270
pixels.

137
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,520
And let's take the showcase

138
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,160
actually let me see that again.

139
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,060
No actually we don't need to do the showcase content.

140
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,720
That's fine.

141
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,130
Let's take the L heading

142
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,720
and the original font size I believe is for REM.

143
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:52,440
So let's say font size and let's set it to three REM and let's take the lead the paragraph has a class

144
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,740
of lead.

145
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,690
We're gonna change that font size to one room which I believe is one point five by default.

146
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,840
And there we go it fits.

147
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,280
So we're targeting 568 height or smaller and then we're at work lessening the font size.

148
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:14,190
But if we go back to like the iPhone X then the font size is normal.

149
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,810
Actually we have this here though

150
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,770
why is that

151
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,290
that shouldn't be there.

152
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:34,160
Because we put the top one hundred ten pixels.

153
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,800
Oh is it because of the margin type let me get rid of that.

154
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,140
Yes it is.

155
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,090
It's because.

156
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,390
OK.

157
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:53,090
So you know what we'll do is we'll only do the margin top negative on heights that are 568 or less.

158
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,670
So showcase content paste that in.

159
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,990
OK.

160
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,960
So that looks good.

161
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,500
Let's go back to the iPhone 5.

162
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,700
Well I guess we still have that problem.

163
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:17,020
So we have to do is add to the top value.

164
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,850
So we have top one hundred ten.

165
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,780
So let's do top let's try 130 in

166
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,380
showcase.

167
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:44,070
That could be why I actually wanted to 130 doesn't seem to be enough let's do one 40.

168
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,140
There we go.

169
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,420
OK so the I mean the iPhone 5 isn't really important at least for me.

170
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,530
But I mean it's good to at least have a look decent on older devices.

171
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,720
OK.

172
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,710
So that's going to be it for this project guys.

173
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,120
Hopefully you enjoyed it and you learned quite a bit from it.

174
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,430
If you run into any little bugs or or you know things that aren't displaying quite right on certain

175
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,890
devices maybe you have some some different kind of Android phone and something doesn't look right then

176
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:23,900
feel free to just tweak it you know go in change some of the values of some of the properties.

177
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,640
I mean this had this Web site obviously isn't like a production Web site that's been fully tested and

178
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,160
and up and running for a while this is something I built for the core so you might run into a couple

179
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,090
things here and they are not just with this project but with any of the projects.

180
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,110
But yeah that's it.

181
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,090
I mean you can use this Web site as kind of a boilerplate or a template for other sites you've just

182
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,250
changed the background image change the colors all that stuff but that's going to be it guys in the

183
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,800
next section.

184
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,460
What I want to do is start to look at Web site deployment because up to this point we've only been building

185
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,860
on our local machine.

186
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:06,910
So I want to show you how to in probably the simplest way possible to upload a Web site to a shared

187
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,750
hosting account.
