1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,280
All right guys so we're gonna get started here and I basically just have an edge ledger underscore Web

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,220
site folder that's completely empty and I open that within V.S. code so you're going to want to do the

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,980
same.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,500
And then in this lecture you'll find an image resources zip file.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,910
So you want to unzip that and we just want to grab all the images that are here and we'll copy these

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,660
into our edu ledger Web site folder.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,760
We want to create a folder called EMG and we want to paste those images in there.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,660
OK.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,050
And then if we go back into v s code you can see we have our images to work with.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,140
So let's create our structure here.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,060
Obviously going to need an index study each time l and this is the only aged female page we need because

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,790
this is a single page Web site.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,600
Everything is on one page.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,810
We just have different areas that the menus go to.

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,710
And this is common.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,290
I'm sure you guys have seen this before and it's actually easier because you don't need as much copy

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:05,100
as much markup our content I should say you know if you just want one section to have a paragraph and

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,730
some list items that's fine and you don't have to think of all this this content and people don't want

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,270
a ton of content to have to read through they want everything just very simple and easy to read and

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,110
understand.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,810
And I think having single page Web sites like this really really helps with that rather than than them

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,080
having to search through all these pages.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,260
So let's put in our boilerplate here actually let's create the rest of the file structure.

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:40,890
We need to see assess folder and in CSX we're gonna have a style dot CSX file.

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:50,220
We're also going to have a mobile dot CSX file and we're gonna have a wide screen DOD CSX because I

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,540
want to style the icons differently depending on on if it's on a wide screen.

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:04,110
And then we're also gonna have a J S folder so javascript and we're gonna have a file inside there called

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,530
Main dot J S which is gonna have the javascript for the Google map as well as the smooth scrolling because

29
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,990
we can't do that when we actually need a little bit of JavaScript for that for the smooth scrolling

30
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:22,470
we're gonna use something called J query which is a javascript library to do all sorts of things.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,330
Animation is is pretty much the only thing that I would use J query for these days.

32
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,110
So something like this smooth scrolling is much much easier with J.

33
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,590
Query.

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,950
But we'll get to that later.

35
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,910
So let's close all these up except for index and then we're going to continue on here.

36
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:49,200
So for the title I'm just going to say edge ledger financial and let's put a pipe character and then

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,350
we'll see accounting and investment.

38
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,960
OK.

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:03,480
Let's put all all of our CSX files so we'll say link tab or link enter and I'm going to say CSX slash

40
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:12,870
style CSX and I'm going to copy this so can shift option or shift Ault on windows down twice this first

41
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:21,630
one I'm going to change to mobile the second one I'm going to change to widescreen and we need to add

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:32,280
media queries or media attributes for mobile and widescreen so let's say screen and we want a max width

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:42,000
of seven sixty 68 pixels OK and then for widescreen let's do media equals screen.

44
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,230
And this time we want to do men with and we want eleven hundred pixels so this will only kick in when

45
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,060
the screen is bigger than eleven hundred pixels.

46
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,490
OK.

47
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:00,510
And we're also going to be using font awesome so let's head over to font awesome dot com and click this

48
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:08,370
button here and grab the link so that we can incorporate icons will pace set in there and our head should

49
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,620
be all set.

50
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,840
So let's go ahead and open this up and we're going to going to have a blank page we have an ad in anything

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,860
yet so going to start with the nav bar obviously we're going to go top to bottom and I put the nav bar

52
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,470
outside of the showcase outside of this header with the idea of showcase and the reason for that is

53
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,860
we're using a sticky nav bar and if we put it inside of the showcase or in the header here what's going

54
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,880
to happen is once we reached the bottom it's going to disappear because it's basically stuck inside

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,970
of its parent.

56
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,940
So we don't want this to have a parent.

57
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,550
So we want to put the nav bar above the showcase.

58
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:48,990
OK.

59
00:04:49,020 --> 00:05:00,870
So let's go into body and let's do nav tag and we want to put an I.D. nav bar and we want inside here

60
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,300
in H1 we'll give it a class of logo.

61
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,500
And inside this H1 as you can see we have an icon.

62
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,860
And then these are both going to be green.

63
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,180
So we need a special class for that.

64
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,920
So let's do let's say span we'll give.

65
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:26,930
Give this a class of text primary and inside here we want to put our icon.

66
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,710
So I with the class of F.A. yes.

67
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,300
And then another class this particular icon is F A Dash book dash open.

68
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,800
And we want the word after the icon we want the word edge.

69
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,090
And then outside of the span we want the word ledger because on the edge should be green.

70
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,290
So ledger.

71
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,050
OK.

72
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,970
So that's our logo and then under that we want our navigation which will be a well.

73
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,260
And we want for list items with links.

74
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,020
So we'll say list item we'll use Emmet here so curly braces we can put in the content which will be

75
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,090
in a tag.

76
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,560
We'll just have this go nowhere.

77
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,930
And then we want four of them so we're gonna say times four and hit enter.

78
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,600
Okay.

79
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,480
And if you don't like Emmett if you don't want to do that stuff you can simply type it all out but I

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,540
think Emmett makes it much more faster much more efficient and you'll get you'll get used to it.

81
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,960
So home let's do what.

82
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,780
Who and contact and then for the links here.

83
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:42,040
They're just going to go to the I.D. home the idea of what.

84
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,300
OK.

85
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,610
So these will be sections who and contact.

86
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:47,970
All right.

87
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,770
Now home as you can see it brings us all the way up to the top.

88
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,140
So I'm going to put the idea of home on the body.

89
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,900
OK.

90
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,790
And this will work even without javascript but it will just kind of click down and it will just go right

91
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,330
down it's not going to have this smooth effect to do that we're using the J.

92
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,650
Query intimate method.

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,990
But for now it's just going to kind of click to that area.

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,400
All right.

95
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,030
So let's see we have our NAV bar.

96
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,600
So I'm just going to put a comment here and seeing nav bar and if we take a look it's going to look

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
horrible.

98
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,570
What I want to do is work on each.

99
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,380
Basically each component at a time so we'll do the nav bar then we'll move on to the showcase then this

100
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,210
area this area and so on and we want to style it as we go.

101
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:46,470
So let's jump into style dot CSX and we'll most likely do the responsiveness after after we get them

102
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,150
the main style down.

103
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:58,480
So in style dot CSX let's first ad like our our base styles our core our core things that that don't

104
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,670
pertain to specific classes and stuff.

105
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,980
So body lengths asterisk.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,750
We want to add a reset but first thing we want to do is implement our font.

107
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,690
I'm actually using that were a bottle font which is not you know a regular font.

108
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:24,540
So we're gonna go to Google our fonts dot google and let's search for rubato and right here I'm going

109
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,910
to click the plus sign go down here click on that and I'm actually going to import want to choose this

110
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,070
and I'm going to imported into our CSX file so you can either do that or you can bring it in as a link

111
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,180
tag and your each team Al but I'm just going to go ahead and just do that.

112
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,290
OK.

113
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,340
And once I do that I should be able to use font family rubato.

114
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,460
So we're for our body.

115
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,480
Let's add in that.

116
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,920
Now I'm going to add a little CSX reset here.

117
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,060
We want to make sure our box sizing is border box.

118
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:08,710
And then I want to just zero out all the margin and padding case or resetting the margin and padding

119
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,760
for everything and then links.

120
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,640
So for lengths I'm just going to remove the underline.

121
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:23,590
So text decoration underline and I want to add a little bit of margin back to the paragraphs because

122
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,280
remember when we add our reset it takes away margin and padding from everything.

123
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:35,100
So four paragraphs let's do zero point seven five REM on the top and bottom and zero left and right.

124
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,690
OK.

125
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,370
So take a look.

126
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,710
Looks like this.

127
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,430
Let's see so next thing I want to do is let's take care of the text primary class.

128
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,900
Remember we wrapped this in text primary.

129
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,560
Let's put a space after that icon.

130
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,610
So right here we'll put a space and that pushes that over a bit.

131
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:13,540
So going to go right here and I'm going to say utility classes do text primary and for text primary

132
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:23,590
you're gonna do a color and the primary color is going to be nine three C B 5 2 which is gonna be that

133
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,060
green color.

134
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,480
All right.

135
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,250
And if I save that we take a look.

136
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,320
Now that's green.

137
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,770
OK.

138
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,050
Now let's let's deal with the nav bar.

139
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,810
So let's see.

140
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,990
Go right under here.

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,510
Let's say nav bar and the nav bar itself.

142
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,400
Let's let's add a background

143
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,410
of 3 3 3 actually save it's going to look like that.

144
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:56,680
You know what.

145
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,270
Let's kind of what I want to show both at the same time.

146
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,120
So I'm going to just shrink this down a little bit that should be good.

147
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,410
OK.

148
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,290
So we have a background and any anything that's not a link we can add color white.

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,630
OK.

150
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,090
So if I say this it's not going to change the the links because that's that's a separate color.

151
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,160
And I want to position this sticky.

152
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:34,060
So I'm actually going to do position for the first value here and let's say sticky and we want to say

153
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,120
top zero.

154
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,660
That's where we want it to stick.

155
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,300
So when we scroll it should stick to the top.

156
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:48,900
Now I want this to be flex because we want the logo over here we want the menu over here.

157
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,090
Now remember the hotel site we used floats and we're not using floats anymore.

158
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:00,910
So let's add right here a display of flex and watch what happens as soon as I do that.

159
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:07,780
Now they're aligned this way not the list items but the whatever is the the child of the nav bar which

160
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:16,570
if we look is the H1 and the well this dish to children k what what is in those children is irrelevant.

161
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,510
These are the flexi items the NAV and the well.

162
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,570
So those get basically floated horizontally.

163
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,710
Now I want this over here.

164
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,040
Right.

165
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,450
So remember the justified content property.

166
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,500
What that does is it aligns things horizontally.

167
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,290
So I'm going to use space between because I want I want the space to be in between both of the Flex

168
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,110
items.

169
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,600
So let's go ahead and just choose it right here space between and save.

170
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,900
And now that gets pushed over to the side.

171
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,170
So let's see.

172
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:01,960
Another thing I want to do here is I want to add a z index so a z index is going to it's basically the

173
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,640
position.

174
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:09,550
I know we went went over this back a while ago but it's the higher the number the closer to the screen

175
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,380
the closer to you it is.

176
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,060
And I want this to always be on top of everything.

177
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,210
When we scroll down so I'm going to put a z index of 1 and that should do it unless we set something

178
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,120
else to z index of 2 or higher than this should go over everything else.

179
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,510
OK.

180
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,310
Hopefully that makes sense.

181
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,840
And then I'm also going to add just a padding value of one room.

182
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,210
So in this case one room is 16 pixels because we haven't touched the eight the root each team.

183
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,010
Font size and that's what REMS are based on.

184
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,730
Next thing we want to do is the well

185
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:52,470
OK now the U.S. is also going to be flex because we want these to align horizontally so let's say display.

186
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,700
OK.

187
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,900
Remember no more floats display flex save.

188
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,490
There we go.

189
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:11,920
And then I'm also going to I'm going to do a line items to the center OK so that kind of puts both of

190
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,930
the logo in this at the same level here.

191
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,950
And let's take away the bullet points.

192
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,160
So list I want to do list style.

193
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,990
None.

194
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,760
OK.

195
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,720
And then we also want to deal with the links.

196
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:38,780
So let's do now Navarre well ally a new color white.

197
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,670
OK so we have our White links.

198
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,340
Wait a minute why is it still underline.

199
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,070
Oh I did text decoration underline there should be none.

200
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,250
All right.

201
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:57,430
So next thing we want to do is separate them because we don't want them right on top of each other so

202
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,800
let's add a padding here and let's just do zero point seventy five.

203
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,060
Right.

204
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:09,530
Notice some using REM for for most most things paintings and stuff like that.

205
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,010
And then let's save that see what we get.

206
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,030
Good.

207
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:22,370
Now I'm also going to add a margin on the one to do a margin on the left and right.

208
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,880
So margin let's do zero and then zero point to five REM on the left and right.

209
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,840
Now when I hover over these I want to have kind of a green box around it.

210
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,890
So let's do the hover state.

211
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:49,330
So now bar you well ally a colon and hover and let's do a background in the background is going to be

212
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,600
the same green that we have right here.

213
00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:00,640
The Texas primary so we'll copy that paste that in and save that.

214
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,500
Let's check it out OK good.

215
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,410
Now I do want the corners to be a little rounded so let's do a border radius and this is all stuff that

216
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,500
we've done so.

217
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,020
We'll do five pixels and we have a little round on the corners.

218
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,280
All right.

219
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,800
So that's it.

220
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,190
That's our NAV bar.

221
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,960
And as you can see it's it's much cleaner using flex than using floats and stuff like that.

222
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,400
And you know you'll see that you'll realize that as we move along especially with the boxes and stuff

223
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,420
like that.

224
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,370
Also aligning in the showcase.

225
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,230
So that's what we're gonna do next is the whole header showcase area.

226
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,730
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
