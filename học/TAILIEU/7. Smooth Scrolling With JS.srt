1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,750
All right guys.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,900
Now we're going to implement our smooth rolling and we're going to have to use javascript with J query

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,470
and I'll explain a little bit about that in a minute but I just want to show you guys something I opened

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:22,560
the site in Safari and with Safari the the position Sticky isn't doesn't work just yet.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,850
So the menu isn't isn't sticking to the top which is fine.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,720
It's not like it breaks or anything it just simply doesn't stick.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:38,010
But one thing I noticed is the spacing right here and to fix that we actually want to go to want to

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,480
go to our style CSX and go to our showcase content and where I have top we actually want to change this

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,070
to 65 which I put in the beginning but it wasn't.

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,490
It was showing extra space down here because I forgot the bottom zero.

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,720
So let's go ahead and save that and notice it still looks fine here.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,750
Everything is good and if I bring safari back in now we don't have that spacing.

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,000
OK.

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,790
And this you know it still works but it just doesn't stick to the top.

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,750
So it's I mean it doesn't hurt to use position stick even though it's not supported in some browsers.

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,300
It just makes a better experience if you're in Chrome or Firefox or browsers that do support it.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,140
OK.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,270
So now let's start let's get into the smooth scrolling now to use J.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,960
Query.

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,370
Let's go to J.

21
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,380
Query dot com.

22
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,020
Now J.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,400
Query was used all the time years a couple of years ago and it's starting to phase out for things like

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,910
dumb Dom selection basically selecting things from the document object model which is basically the

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,560
hierarchy of each time all tags and attributes and content in the browser.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,340
Now you can do all this stuff with vanilla javascript which is just regular javascript so there's a

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,310
lot of things you don't need a query for that you used to.

28
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,720
However animation is one that is kind of difficult to do and in some situations.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,470
So things like Sly sliders and scrolling effects and stuff J.

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,460
Query makes this stuff really easy.

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,010
So we're gonna be using it for this.

32
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,630
This one feature now you could download the javascript.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,510
It's just basically a javascript file you could download it.

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,200
We're going to use what's called a C D N which we've actually been using with font.

35
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,220
Awesome.

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,850
If you look in our index each team I'll file our font awesome CSX is coming from somewhere else right.

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,510
It's not it's not located in our local file here.

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,230
It's coming from this huge dot font awesome dot com.

39
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,860
So we're going to do the same type of thing with J query.

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,590
So I just need to find where we can get the C.D. in here right here using J.

41
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,140
Query with a C.D. And then it stands for content delivery network.

42
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,180
So let's go

43
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,260
Jake right here.

44
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,840
So Jake Query CDM provided by stack path.

45
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,950
No that's not it.

46
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,060
You know I can't find it is because.

47
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,390
OK.

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,760
So that's the fire.

49
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,710
I usually just type in J query C.D. And yeah.

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,250
So right here code dot J.

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,130
Cary dot com and then there's different versions we're gonna choose the latest which is J.

52
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,560
Query three and one thing you don't want to do is choose the slim version the reason for that is with

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,590
the smooth scrolling we're actually using the intimate function or the intimate method and that's not

54
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,440
included in the slim version so you can choose the uncompressed which is just the regular JavaScript

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,650
file are minute offside which means that all the whitespace is removed all the comments things like

56
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,680
that and it makes your file a little makes it a little faster because it's smaller.

57
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,710
So we'll go ahead and choose the minute fied and then it's gonna give us a script tag that has the J

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,640
Cary CDM.

59
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,800
So we can copy this we're actually can just click this that you copy it to your clipboard and then we'll

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:22,470
go back into our index file go down to the bottom and we're gonna pace this in above our main J Yes.

61
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:34,800
In fact I'm going to put a comment here and say this is our local J.S. file and this is Google Maps

62
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:44,150
and then above the local we're gonna put our J query C.D. in.

63
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,800
So we're just including the J query JavaScript file from somewhere else.

64
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,650
Now it's important to put it above the main J S because we're using J.

65
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,650
Query inside of this javascript file if we put this below it.

66
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,840
It's not going to know what we're talking about.

67
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,210
OK.

68
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,280
So it's it's important to use this order.

69
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:10,080
Now we did use Google Maps inside the main J Yes but notice that in the script tag that Google gave

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
us they use async defer.

71
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,930
So that makes it so that we can actually put it down here and we can still use it in this manger.

72
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,800
Yes.

73
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:26,620
So let's save this and let's go into our main J.S. and I'm going to just pace this in

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,950
and this is our little code snippet for smooth scrolling.

75
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:39,750
So basically we're targeting the nav bar any link that's inside the nav bar.

76
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,910
Because if we look at our code here.

77
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,940
All right I'm sorry our markup our HD.

78
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,390
We have our whereas it's I.D. nav bar and we're targeting the link k.

79
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,710
So if any link is clicked.

80
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,300
So we're saying on click which is an event then we run a function.

81
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:58,900
OK.

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:06,340
Now this function we're checking for the hash because when we click this we're basically looking at

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,180
these the hash and then whatever the ideas.

84
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,830
And then we're gonna call the animate on the body on the H team Allen body and we want to scroll from

85
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,290
the top to that hash.

86
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,360
OK.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,100
I mean you don't need to understand all this but that's what it's doing it's going to basically do a

88
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,150
smooth scroll and this is the speed at which it's going to do it.

89
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:39,490
So you can you can make this faster or slower it's in milliseconds so a hundred milliseconds and then

90
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,800
we also want to do it with the class of button.

91
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,340
And the reason I put that there is because if we look at the Showcase we have the read more.

92
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,990
And it goes to the what.

93
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,470
And it has a class of button.

94
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,890
So if we click that I also want that smooth scrolling implemented.

95
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,740
So I'm going to go ahead and save this.

96
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,520
Our main JSA is already being included so it should work.

97
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,920
So we'll go back here and say what.

98
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,660
And it's scroll this down.

99
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,690
And the reason that it's not covering the the title anymore is because I put this in here I basically

100
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:20,610
said you know we want to scroll down to the I.D. And we want to minus one.

101
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
If I don't have this here

102
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:32,930
so if we do that and we say what you can see it's still covering I go to who is still covering it.

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,540
So adding that negative 100 pixels that fixed it.

104
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,670
So now we can actually see the titles.

105
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,080
OK.

106
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,600
So I mean like I said don't worry if that doesn't make sense it's absolutely fine.

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:55,820
I want to add one more snippet of JavaScript so that when we start to scroll this nav bar has a little

108
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:02,720
bit of opacity a little bit of transparency so we can see through it right now it's completely solid

109
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,840
but I only want to do it when we're not one more so when we scroll down from the top.

110
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,400
So let me just add that in real quick.

111
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:18,530
So in Maine dot J.S. put that right here and basically this isn't J J query.

112
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
This is just regular javascript.

113
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,160
Adding an event to the window.

114
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,430
OK.

115
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,330
So in our in JavaScript you have a window object which is the whole browser and we're listening for

116
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:36,050
a scroll and we're saying if the scroll y position is greater than 150 basically if we're scroll down

117
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:42,800
more than one and 150 we're going to select the nav bar and we're going to set the opacity to zero point

118
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,350
nine which will give it a slight transparency.

119
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,110
Else if we're less than 150.

120
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,810
So basically if it's up at the top then the opacity will be 1.

121
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,210
It's not going to be and it's not going to be transparent at all.

122
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,290
So let's save that and notice it's not transparent.

123
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:06,060
But as soon as I go more than 150 down which is right you'll see it kick in right here.

124
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,500
See how.

125
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,020
Now you can see through it.

126
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,620
If I go up you can't.

127
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,000
That's because we're hitting that 150 position.

128
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,590
And now as we scroll down we can see through it.

129
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,690
So as you can see you can do some really cool things with JavaScript and even J query but we're not

130
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,030
going to get into that.

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,110
This course is about H2 on CSX but that's definitely the direction you want to go after this.

132
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,890
But let's let's check it out in Safari while we're at it.

133
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:40,560
So let me just grab the URL here and yes.

134
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,850
So it's just going to be you know stuck to the top which is fine.

135
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,160
And then another thing I want to do is just get rid of the space and edge ledger.

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,450
That should all be one word.

137
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:56,730
So in the logo let's see we have edge here is this.

138
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,400
Think the space is right here.

139
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,420
Save that.

140
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:01,890
And yeah.

141
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,070
Now it's all one word.

142
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,200
OK.

143
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,180
So I believe that the just the regular sight is complete.

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,570
So all we have to do now is the responsiveness which we have to deal with the menu because if we go

145
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,110
to small you can see it can kind of mess up.

146
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,380
I just want the logo on top.

147
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,780
Have this centered.

148
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,080
And this.

149
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,550
We want these to stack.

150
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,920
We want this.

151
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,800
We want to get rid of the image and just have this clients I want these images to be a little bigger.

152
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,020
We're also going to get rid of the last one so there's only four.

153
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,170
And then we're going to put the map on the bottom of the contact.

154
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:46,930
Also on wide screens I want the icon here to float or not float but we're going to use flex blocks.

155
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,710
I want it to be aligned to the left as opposed to just being in the middle always.

156
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,490
OK.

157
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,550
Also on tablets if it's like this size I want it to.

158
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,060
I want it to stack.

159
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,570
So that's all stuff that will have to do with the mobile dot CSX and the wide screen dots CSX.

160
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:04,810
OK.

161
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,480
So hopefully you guys are enjoying this and you're able to follow along and things are making sense.

162
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,330
If a couple things don't.

163
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,220
Don't worry about it.

164
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,560
I mean it happens we're not going to understand every single thing.

165
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,850
The first time around.

166
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,360
So you know it'll it'll come to you in whether it's in this course in the future and in future projects

167
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,150
and in sections or just creating your own projects and so on.

168
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,410
All right.

169
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,990
So that's it.

170
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,270
I'll see you in the next video.
