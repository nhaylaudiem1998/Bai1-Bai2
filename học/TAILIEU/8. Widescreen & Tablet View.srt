1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,870
All right so our project is is pretty much done for just regular screen sizes.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,890
But in this video I want to tackle wide screens and just tablets.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,030
And then in the next video we'll deal with smaller mobile devices.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:25,650
So on wide screens and on tablets I want the the icon here to to basically align to the left.

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,800
So I want to turn each item into a flex container so that they go horizontal.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,670
This div and this icon are horizontal even know these are flex items themselves.

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,900
They can also be flex containers.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,020
So let's head over actually one thing I want to do before that and then we should have did this in the

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,950
beginning.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,170
So we have this style CSM and below the mobile on the wide screen.

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,070
We don't want to do that.

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,440
We want the original style sheet above those two.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,980
So I'm going to go ahead and just control C copy this and delete it and then move it above the wide

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,980
screen and the Mobile case.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,160
We're going to do that and save.

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:18,390
Otherwise the the styles from style C CSX are gonna overwrite what we have in here unless we use important

17
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,830
tags which I don't want to put all over the place.

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,930
So let's do that.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,780
Let's open up wide screen dots.

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:31,110
SS And like I said I want to turn each of these items into a flex container so that these are aligned

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,360
horizontally.

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:45,680
So to do that let's let's put a comment here we'll say a line icon to left so we'll take the what I

23
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,720
I.D. the items and then the item itself.

24
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,160
OK.

25
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,320
Because each of these have a class of item.

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,180
We're going to turn it into a flex block.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,650
So display flex and save.

28
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,270
And notice that.

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,850
Now they align this way and don't worry about this we're going to fix that.

30
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,710
Now I want the text now to align to the left not the center.

31
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:19,720
So let's say text a line to the left and save that.

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,890
There we go.

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:32,200
Now for the icon we're gonna do some stuff with that so let's target the icon save position icon.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,390
So we want the what I.D. then items.

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,180
Then item and then the eye.

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,590
OK.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,540
Because that's that's where that the icon classes and first of all I'm going to add a margin to the

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,320
right of one point three REM.

39
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:57,310
Because as you can see there's no spacing right here so now we're taking this this icon and we're putting

40
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,350
some margin on the right.

41
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,080
So I save the seconds pushed over.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,240
OK.

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,940
Another thing I want to do is fix this.

44
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,310
I want to align this in the middle.

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:14,080
So we're going to use the aligned dash self and we want to set that to center and save.

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,270
And now that puts that in the center.

47
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,470
And this by default has some margin bottom just from when we had it on the top.

48
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,280
So I'm going to clear that by just saying margin bottom and zero.

49
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,000
OK.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,760
So I think that looks pretty good.

51
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,480
And another thing I want to do on wide screens is I don't want the map in the form to be even I want

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,770
the map to take up more space.

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,160
So if you remember we have flex one for both of these in fact I'll show you in style CSX.

54
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:54,280
If we go down here we have flex one for both the map and the contact form so on wide screens I'm going

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,620
to take the map and I'm going to add Flex 2 and save.

56
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,410
And now you can see that the map is wider.

57
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:12,310
And then when I get below eleven hundred it goes back to being even now on small screens and we get

58
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,510
to 768.

59
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,740
I also want I want these to stack on top of each other but I also want them to have the icon on the

60
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,970
left just like with wide screens.

61
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:29,440
So I'm actually going to copy these two styles here and put them into mobile dots.

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,820
SS OK.

63
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,460
Now if I save it it's going to look like that which doesn't look good because we need to stack these

64
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,710
on top of each other meaning we have to remove the flex so right up here.

65
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:48,170
Let's target what items.

66
00:04:48,700 --> 00:05:00,970
And initially we had it set to flex but now we want to basically clear that flex and say display block

67
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,610
so we'll save that.

68
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,930
Let's add a little bit of a padding one room and there he goes.

69
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,970
Now they're stacked and that looks pretty good.

70
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,940
I mean you could keep it.

71
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,150
He could keep these in the middle like if we remove this and we save.

72
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,050
He could have that but I honestly think that this looks better now.

73
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,360
Every other style that we do in the mobile dot CSX I want to be four or five hundred pixels or less

74
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,440
because tablets tablets should look fine.

75
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,210
In fact if we go ahead and look at our mobile view here with our chrome tools iPhone obviously this

76
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,930
doesn't look good.

77
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,400
The menu doesn't this doesn't this doesn't.

78
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,350
We're gonna have to fix all this stuff.

79
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:59,190
But for the iPad I think things look pretty good.

80
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,760
It's big enough it's wide enough to keep this flex here and here the menu looks good.

81
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,950
We can even add more links.

82
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,810
And yeah I think that's fine.

83
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:17,860
So in the next video we're going to target you know iPhone apps iPhone X 6 7 8.

84
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,920
And if it does this with this this side here I'm not sure why that happens.

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,720
But notice if I just re save my file that goes away.

86
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,440
So I'm not sure what that is it's some kind of bug.

87
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,290
But yeah I'm gonna just clear this up.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,990
And in the next video we're gonna start to work on basically you know smaller screens that are under

89
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,760
500.

90
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,380
So we're gonna add a media query here for that and we'll put our all of our styles in there.
