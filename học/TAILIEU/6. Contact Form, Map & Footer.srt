1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,190
OK so now we're gonna work on the contact section which does have a Google map.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,060
We'll probably get to it in this video would if not then we'll we'll get to it in the next one because

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,530
I do want to do the form first.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,050
So let's go down to the bottom here.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:22,050
We'll add another comment for section of contact and let's do a section tag giving an idea of contact

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,840
and we're going to have basically I call this contact section is going to be a flex container.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,080
And then the map and the form are gonna be the Flex items.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:42,750
So the first one will be the form so I'll give it a class of its to contact dash form.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,690
So this will have the form in it and then I'm gonna do a class of map.

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,400
Now the Google map that nothing goes inside of here.

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,630
Everything is basically done through javascript.

12
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,000
OK so we'll have to look into that after.

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,800
But let's add the form for now.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:09,610
So I'm actually going to also add class of B G dash primary which I don't believe we've done yet but

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,560
this is where we have the green background the primary color as the background.

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,670
And then I'm gonna do P2 which will give padding all around.

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,380
So inside here let's do an H two.

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,920
Let's use our M heading class and we'll say contact us.

19
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:43,130
And then inside the paragraph will say please use the form below to contact us okay.

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,210
And then let's do a form.

21
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,600
We don't need an action we're not actually submitting it.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,200
And then here we'll do a class of form dash group which wraps the label in the input.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:06,510
So label safe for name and then let's do an input with the type of text and the name will be name I.D.

24
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,860
We'll be name and then let's also add a placeholder

25
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,360
and we'll say enter name.

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,850
OK.

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,480
So if we take a look at that it can see it's very ugly looking for now and then we'll to copy this form

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,340
group what's copy this down.

29
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,350
See two three four for these.

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
The second one is gonna be the email.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,960
So let's change the four attribute to email.

32
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,880
We'll change this to email.

33
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:49,860
The type will change to email the name and the I.D. email and we'll say enter email for the place holder

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,120
K and then we're gonna have phone number.

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:04,620
So this is gonna be phone and let's see the type we'll just keep that as text the name is gonna be phone

36
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,650
I.D. phone and then we'll say enter

37
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,030
a phone number.

38
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,980
And then this last one is gonna be a message.

39
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:27,660
So for message label message and it's gonna be a text area instead of an input.

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,460
So I'm going to get rid of the input in the type and I'm gonna replace that with text area and we need

41
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:41,420
to add an ending text area tag as well and we'll say enter message for the place holder will change

42
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,590
the name and the I.D. to message as well.

43
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,080
OK.

44
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,960
Now we only we just need to do a submit.

45
00:03:49,970 --> 00:04:01,760
So let's go under the div and let's do an input with the type of submit and the value is just the text

46
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,520
that's gonna read so we'll just say.

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:12,030
I will say send for the value and then I just want a class of B T N and I'm also gonna make this dark

48
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,810
remember we have that B10 and dark class that we created in our C Ss so let's save that and it should

49
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,620
look like this.

50
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:19,950
OK.

51
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,690
So now let's add the styling for the form we also want to add that big primary right here because we

52
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,610
don't have that as a class.

53
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:40,130
So let's go up to our utilities go right under big dark and say B G primary in background is gonna be

54
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,870
that this green color.

55
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,050
OK.

56
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,540
And then color is gonna be white.

57
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,930
So that's big primary.

58
00:04:50,930 --> 00:05:04,390
Now down below down at the bottom under the clients section know we'll do a c section clients that's

59
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,260
a section

60
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,090
contact.

61
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,740
Let's see.

62
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:22,770
So are the contact itself the idea of contact that's gonna be our flex so let's say display flex Kay

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,760
now the map.

64
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,770
Let's see I want the contact form and the map by default to have a flex one so that there even when

65
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,560
it's on a wide screen I'm going to change it so that the form is smaller and the map is bigger.

66
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:48,680
But for now let's take contact in the class of map.

67
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,910
Actually what we can do is just add them both to put a comma and we'll say take contact in the class

68
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:03,740
of contact form and let's say flex one for both.

69
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,570
So now it's just even now it's style.

70
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,880
The the inputs to label stuff like that.

71
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:20,600
So the form group so contact and then contact form and then the form group.

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm just gonna add a margin so that they're separated a bit.

73
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,300
So let's do zero point seven five rems.

74
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,220
OK.

75
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,340
And then we'll do the label because I want the label to display block.

76
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,540
Right now it's in line.

77
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,960
You can see it's you know it's to the left of the input but I want it to be on top.

78
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,270
So let's take.

79
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,080
Contact.

80
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:53,210
Contact form label and let's display as a block level elements of a save that you'll see that now it's

81
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,560
on top.

82
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:54,950
All right.

83
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,120
And then for the input in the text area so we'll see.

84
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Contact.

85
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:08,770
Contact form input as well.

86
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,880
As the text area.

87
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,550
Let's go ahead and set a width of 100 percent.

88
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,770
So it goes all the way across and let's add some padding say zero point five.

89
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,490
And there we go.

90
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,920
So that looks pretty decent now.

91
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,290
Yeah.

92
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,520
Now we'll work on the map.

93
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,740
So what we're gonna have to do is you can have to log into your Google account and then I want you to

94
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:46,240
just type in search Google console not the search console we want the cloud console because we're working

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,140
with a Google map that means that we need an API key because it has to make a request to the Google

96
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,660
servers to get the location and all that stuff.

97
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,550
So let's let's go.

98
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,980
You gonna have to have a project.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,270
OK.

100
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,260
Now I already have one called dev one.

101
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,610
If you don't have a project just do new project call it whatever you want.

102
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,320
Once you have a project if you click over here an API and services it's going to show you.

103
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,510
Let's see right here we want to say enable API is in services and it's going to show you all the different

104
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,490
Google services which there's tons of.

105
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:33,830
We want maps right here maps javascript API.

106
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,790
OK so you weren't to want to click that mine's already enabled you'll probably see a button that says

107
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:45,270
enable make sure you click that and then you should see something like this.

108
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,770
Make sure it's enabled.

109
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:53,460
Mine is as you can see I have a disable option and then you want to go to credentials and you want to

110
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,360
create an API key so let's see.

111
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,970
I mean you can see mine right here.

112
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,880
Where would we go here.

113
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:11,470
I mean I already have one but you should see something like create new API key I believe.

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,560
Credentials API manager.

115
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,190
Here we go.

116
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:23,520
So create credentials API key and it'll give you something that looks like this and you can restricted

117
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,010
to certain domains and stuff but we're not going to do that just go ahead and save it.

118
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,990
So now you should have an API key.

119
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,580
I'm just going to see you.

120
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,610
I just want to check which one of these I actually used.

121
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,780
Let's see where is it.

122
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,180
Yes.

123
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,270
All right.

124
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,160
So I use this one here so you can actually copy it if you click this it'll copy it to your click clipboard

125
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,010
and for now I'm going to go into my index each team Tim Allen I'm just gonna put this inside of a comment

126
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,640
down here just so I have it all right.

127
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,330
Now next thing we're gonna want to do is go ahead and search for Google Map docs.

128
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,620
And click on the first link here the overview.

129
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,460
And this basically tells us what we need to do.

130
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:27,600
So we need to add a script tag so a script tag just includes a javascript file and we're including the

131
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,150
javascript maps file.

132
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,510
But we also need to put in our API key.

133
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,210
All right.

134
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,450
And then we need to add a little bit of JavaScript.

135
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,360
Ours is going to be it's going to resemble this but instead of putting it inside of script tags right

136
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,950
in our each team Al we're going to put it in that main J main dot J S file that we created.

137
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,730
And notice that they have a div with the idea of map.

138
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,470
We used a class but it doesn't really matter we can target a div or a class.

139
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,720
And that's where the map goes.

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,860
And then you can see up here they set the height to 100 percent because it's like it's like a background

141
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,830
image it needs to have a height or it needs to have some kind of content in it to actually display.

142
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,230
So what we're gonna do is just copy this right here this script.

143
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,430
We're gonna go back into our H team.

144
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,650
I'll go right above the body.

145
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,940
We're gonna pace that in and where it says your API key in all caps.

146
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,430
You're gonna grab your API key and just put it right in there so when it controls C to copy it and then

147
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,320
control V to pace that right in there.

148
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,810
All right.

149
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:42,720
Now we also need to include our main dot J S file so we're gonna go right above it and put in a script

150
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
tag.

151
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,270
So if we do script and then a colon and then S.R. C that will add a source attribute.

152
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,690
OK.

153
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,860
Just like an image when you have an image you point it to a source.

154
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,150
Right.

155
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,900
Well with a javascript file we also use source.

156
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,910
So we're going to point to the J S folder so we can do.

157
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,370
Yeah.

158
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:12,260
We'll just do J ust slash main Todd J.S. now I mean we're not talking too much about JavaScript in this

159
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:19,900
course but just remember when you include javascript you use source when you include CSX you use a traffic.

160
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,260
OK.

161
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,560
And when I know that some people when they're starting out they get that confused they'll do a they'll

162
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,930
do link and then source like that or a script tag within a traffic.

163
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,740
Just remember that JavaScript uses the source to attribute.

164
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,300
So that will include the main J S file.

165
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:47,300
So let's go ahead and save this and then we want to actually go into our main dot J ust file and I'm

166
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm gonna actually paste in the javascript and then I'll quickly go over it.

167
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,970
Like I said this is not a javascript course.

168
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,350
I don't really want to get too much into it.

169
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,300
I do have a 21 hour javascript course on you to me if you're interested which I would recommend after

170
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,200
this one.

171
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:10,470
So I'm going to pace this and you guys can copy this or you can you can get it from the finished project.

172
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:17,750
And basically what's happening here if we look in the index page Tim Al it's linking to the maps API

173
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,200
and it's it has this callback equals init to map this init map is a function.

174
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,020
OK it's this function here that we're creating.

175
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:33,410
So it's going to call this in nit map and it is short for initialize and then what we're doing here

176
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,180
is putting in our location which is this is actually called a javascript object and it has a latitude

177
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,620
and longitude.

178
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,740
Now this this latitude and longitude is actually is centred in Boston Massachusetts.

179
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,150
If you want your map to be somewhere else you can get the latitude and longitude from from there.

180
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,390
And there certain sites you can do that with.

181
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:06,260
So let's just say like get the latitude and longitude from an address and if you go to lat long dot

182
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,570
net you can put in any address here like it or anything.

183
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,170
We could just say like New York

184
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:21,700
and find and it'll get us just a random place in New York which you can see here so you could put any

185
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,960
any any latitude and longitude that you want into this object.

186
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,290
OK.

187
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,640
But if we're just going to stick with with Boston Massachusetts.

188
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,010
Now this here is creating what's called a variable called map and we're sending it to a new Google map.

189
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,070
And then this document dot query selector is targeting the class of map.

190
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,420
OK.

191
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,970
Now remember in our index each team Al we have this class of map.

192
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,420
So we're targeting that and that's where we want to insert the map and you can change the zoom level.

193
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,190
So we're going to keep it at 14 but you can lower it if you want or higher it.

194
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,880
And then we're saying the center position is going to be in the location K the location was also put

195
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,770
into a variable which is basically a place holder.

196
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,120
And if you don't understand anything I'm saying don't worry about it.

197
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,030
Down here is we're reporting on marker because we want a marker in that special location.

198
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:22,420
So we're saying create a new marker and the position should be the location which is this variable.

199
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,440
And the map should show this map.

200
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,550
So hopefully that makes at least a little bit of sense of what's going on here.

201
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,900
I don't expect you to know javascript yet.

202
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,260
So let's save this.

203
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,420
And if we go back to our project this is our project.

204
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,470
We have a map.

205
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,630
OK.

206
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,860
So it's as simple as that.

207
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,200
If that was simple maybe that was really hard if you're just getting into this if you're if you're already

208
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,230
familiar with JavaScript and stuff and you've been watching like tutorials and this is probably brutal

209
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:05,610
for you to watch because it's very it's this at some point this is going to be very simple for you.

210
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,260
But yeah we have our map.

211
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,460
We have our form so good.

212
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,760
Now I think that we can get our footer in here.

213
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,320
That's the last thing on the page.

214
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
There's nothing not really anything to it.

215
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:25,120
So let's head back to index H Tim Al and under our section here let's put in our footer going to use

216
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,500
the footer tag.

217
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,270
And I'm also going to give it an idea of main dash footer.

218
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,900
All right.

219
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,270
And then in here we're just going to put a paragraph with a copy right.

220
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,860
So we'll say copyright.

221
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:45,940
We'll put our Ampersand copy semicolon remember that we'll say twenty not twenty ninety one be long

222
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:58,510
gone by then copyright twenty nineteen edge ledger and we'll say all rights reserved for our text and

223
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:04,630
then actually want to put that in a container so that it stays in the middle so we'll just move this

224
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,560
up into the container and then I want to add some extra classes to this footer.

225
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:23,110
So let's do b g dash dark and let's do text dash center and then P Y dash one to put the padding on

226
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:31,940
the top and the bottom and we'll save that and there we go that looks good so we're gonna go ahead and

227
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,970
stop here and in the next video we're gonna add our smooth scrolling which is also javascript.

228
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,530
I'll go over very briefly.

229
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,970
We'll be using something called J query which we'll talk about a little bit but right now I can hit

230
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:51,920
what brings us down to the what the WHO the menu does cover some of it because the menu is basically

231
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,540
fixed the rest of the site doesn't pay attention to this.

232
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:03,530
The spacing here so it does start like up here but we can actually kind of work that out with the with

233
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,850
the j query.

234
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,120
All right.

235
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,470
So I'll see you in the next video.
