00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,480
All right guys so we have enough under our belt to start to create really cool projects and this Web

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,340
site that we're going to be building is called Edge ledger which is the name of a fictional company

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,430
which is basically an accounting firm or an investment firm something like that.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,250
It's obviously not a real company and like these aren't real clients I have my logo here but these are

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,060
just stock logos that I found.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,770
And I'll have a folder in this lecture called Image Resources.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,000
You can get all the images but we're going to do quite a bit here.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,790
We're going to use flex for everything.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,720
So just to align all this stuff in the middle we'll use flex we'll use flex on the menus.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,190
We're going to use it to align these three boxes these to the contact.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,700
It is a single page and it has a menu so if we click like what it will take us to what we do who takes

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,200
us to who we are contact will take us down to the contact.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Now this is not a javascript course but we will be implementing a little bit of JavaScript code here

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,760
specifically for the map because you do need to use a little bit of JavaScript to get a Google map to

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,940
display as well as the smooth scrolling here.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,230
So we're gonna use a little bit of J query for that.

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,830
I do have a course called Modern javascript from the beginning but this particular course is not focused

18
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,050
on javascript so we're not going to get deep into the code or anything like that.

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,340
But I did want to make it look pretty cool and have the scrolling effect and so on.

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,260
You might also notice the overlay on the image this image is actually much brighter than this.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,870
We're going to UCSF to give a dark overlay so that the text is very readable.

22
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,160
All right.

23
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,530
We probably won't do that to the end.

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,000
Another thing we're going to do is make this menu sticky.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,290
Notice how it always stays at the top no matter where we are.

26
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,970
That way if we click who you know we can easily go up to what without having to go back up.

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,770
That would kind of defeat the purpose.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,350
So we're going to implement this sticky menu you can see it has a little bit of transparency.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,940
So it's I think it's a pretty good looking site.

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,640
We'll also be using font awesome.

31
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,850
I'm going to show you how we can style them to have these background circles and so on.

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,960
So it's it's quite a large project relative to the hotel Web site.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,920
It's also going to be responsive.

34
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:23,190
So we're going to have media queries and once we get to Mobile size you can see the menu changes and

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,720
if we go down here these are all stacked.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,140
We get rid of the image of the people we stack the map underneath the form.

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,250
So it looks good on mobile devices and if I want to check on an actual device we'll use our chrome tools.

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,710
So this is an iPhone 6 7 and 8 and everything looks pretty good.

39
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,750
Obviously iPhone X is going to look good.

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,810
Even the iPhone 5 looks good OK.

41
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,620
And if we take a look at let's do iPhone X and let's do.

42
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,450
What does it landscape.

43
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,330
So that's what it's going to look like on landscape.

44
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,970
We're gonna be using VH units for the showcase so it should look good on all devices.

45
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,360
All right.

46
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,320
That's the goal here.

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,090
So that's it.

48
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,280
Hopefully guys enjoy this project and we're gonna jump in and get started.
